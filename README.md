### Project Objectives:
1. **Real-time Environmental Monitoring:**
   - Implement IoT sensors to collect real-time data on temperature and humidity in public parks.
   - Ensure continuous monitoring and data updating at regular intervals.

2. **Aiding Park Visitors in Activity Planning:**
   - Develop algorithms to interpret environmental data and provide recommendations to park visitors.
   - Provide insights, such as suggesting suitable times for picnics, outdoor sports, etc., based on current environmental conditions.

3. **Promoting Outdoor Experiences:**
   - Create features on the platform that highlight the benefits of outdoor activities, considering the current weather conditions.
   - Provide tips and suggestions for outdoor activities during specific weather conditions.

4. **Enhancing Visitor Satisfaction:**
   - Gather user feedback through the platform to understand visitor preferences and improve the system accordingly.
   - Implement user-friendly interfaces and interactive features on the platform to enhance user experience.

### IoT Devices Designs:
1. **Sensor Selection:**
   - Choose appropriate temperature and humidity sensors compatible with IoT technology.
   - Ensure sensors are durable, weather-resistant, and capable of providing accurate real-time data.

2. **Deployment Plan:**
   - Strategically place sensors in different areas of the parks to ensure comprehensive coverage.
   - Consider factors like park size, topography, and visitor density when deciding sensor deployment locations.
   - Regularly calibrate and maintain sensors to ensure data accuracy.

### Environmental Monitoring Platform:
1. **Web-Based Platform Design:**
   - Create an intuitive and visually appealing web interface accessible to park visitors.
   - Display real-time temperature and humidity data along with graphical representations for easy understanding.
   - Include interactive maps showing sensor locations and real-time data from each location.

2. **User-Friendly Features:**
   - Implement user profiles, allowing visitors to customize their preferences and receive personalized activity suggestions.
   - Include historical data and trends to help users make informed decisions about their park visits.
   - Integrate notifications/alerts to inform users about significant weather changes or ideal outdoor activity times.

### Integration Approach:
1. **Data Transmission:**
   - Utilize IoT communication protocols (such as MQTT or HTTP) for transmitting data from sensors to the monitoring platform securely.
   - Implement encryption and authentication methods to ensure data privacy and security during transmission.

2. **Data Processing and Presentation:**
   - Develop backend scripts using Python to process incoming data, perform analysis, and generate recommendations.
   - Use Python frameworks like Django or Flask to create the web application for the monitoring platform.
   - Ensure seamless integration between the sensor data processing scripts and the web application for real-time updates.

3. **Scalability and Maintenance:**
   - Design the system architecture to be scalable, allowing for the addition of more sensors or features in the future.
   - Implement a robust maintenance plan, including regular sensor checks, software updates, and user support mechanisms.
